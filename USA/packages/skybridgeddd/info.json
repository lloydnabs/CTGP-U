The final lap version of the track jumps straight into the main part of the piece now, so hopefully it's more exciting than the first release for those few that downloaded it when I uploaded it originally. Enjoy! Thanks to Atlas for the FLAP music tool and WayForward and Jake Kaufman for original music ownership.",
